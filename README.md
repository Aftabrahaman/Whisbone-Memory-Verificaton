# Whisbone-Memory-Verificaton
- Designed a Wishbone-compliant memory interface in Verilog, supporting configurable read/write operations and burst transfers.
- Integrated the memory interface with Wishbone master and slave modules, ensuring seamless data transfer and protocol compliance.
- Verified the design using SystemVerilog and UVM, developing reusable testbenches and achieving 100% functional and code coverage.
- Conducted timing analysis and optimized critical paths to meet performance requirements for FPGA and ASIC implementations.
- Debugged design issues using waveform analysis tools, ensuring protocol adherence and interoperability with system components.
- Delivered a fully functional and verified Wishbone memory interface ready for system-level integration.
